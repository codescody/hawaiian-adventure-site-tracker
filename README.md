# Hawaiian Adventure Tracker APP README 

## Getting Started

This is my first full stack application build. It was an exciting way to see what I can do while learning Express and MongoDB. I am excited to work continually on this and update it as I go.

## Issues and Resolutions

My routes were basic and though out before getting started so I was able to complete them relatively quickly. Once I had my routes I found that styling needed extra work compared to our Portfolio Project and required additional testing. I spent most of my time getting the application to look better and ensuring that everything would display on the page accordingly.

## Next Steps

I would like to add multiple models for different types of data. Examples of these would be Surf Spots, Dive Sites, and Restaurants.
I would also like to add authentication which I think is needed for an application like this. Normally I would absolutely have authentication on an edit or delete option. Lastly there is always more to polish with styling!
