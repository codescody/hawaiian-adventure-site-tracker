## Issues and Resolutions

My routes were basic and though out before getting started so I was able to complete them relatively quickly. Once I had my routes I found that styling needed extra work compared to our Portfolio Project and required additional testing. I spent most of my time getting the application to look better and ensuring that everything would display on the page accordingly.
